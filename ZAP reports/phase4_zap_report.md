## Alert Detail



### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (High)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=username
userValue=kissa5@kissa.com
passwordParam=password
referer=https://localhost:8000/login`

Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

### [ Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10027/)

### [ Loosely Scoped Cookie ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90033/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `The origin domain used for comparison was:
localhost
session_id=203002c7-2c70-4653-bca8-160229eb69b4
`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Always scope cookies to a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

### [ Modern Web Application ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10109/)

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `<script src="/static/reservations.js"></script>`

  * Method: `POST`
