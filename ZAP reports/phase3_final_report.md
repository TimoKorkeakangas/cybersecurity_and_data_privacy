| Format String Error Vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to a Format String error, which can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands. | The vulnerability was detected during a security scan by ZAP | To address this issue, the application code should be reviewed and fixed to ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized and do not get executed as commands. |
| Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Weakness. The application contains a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a JSON response, potentially exposing users to malicious attacks. | The vulnerability was detected during a security scan by ZAP. | To mitigate XSS attacks, the application should sanitize and validate input data properly. |
| Private IP Disclosure. The application exposes private IP addresses in the HTTP response body, potentially aiding attackers in targeting internal systems. | The vulnerability was detected during a security scan by ZAP. | The application should not expose private IP addresses in its responses. Proper data handling and sanitization techniques should be implemented to prevent the leakage of sensitive information. |
| Admin tool is visible to normal user. Normal users can view and access Add a new resource tool. | Manual review of the program and user interface. | To fix the issue of a normal user accessing the admin tool on a website, you can implement role-based access control (RBAC) and conditional access policies. |
| When users reserve a resource, their email addresses are displayed under the Username tab in the Reservations list. This exposure of verified email addresses poses various threats and risks of misuse. | Manual review of the program and user interface. | The reserver's username or email should be accessible only to admins in the reservations list. Regular users do not need and should not have access to information about who has made a reservation for a resource. |
